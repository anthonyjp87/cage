# cage

This is a stand alone python game that is created based on an interview I saw with the composer John Cage.

The game is simple--get a random topic and a number of seconds and speak (intelligently) about the topic for the specified amount of time.

So, this game selects a random amount of time based on the cagenum.csv file. This file contains 1000 numbers in a specific distribution of random int's' starting at 1 and tapering off around thrity. 

The file CageWord is a list of many random words which the user can add or subtract. 


Additionally, Instead of only getting seconds + word, I've added Lines and Words. So randomly, the user will get either seconds, lines, or words and a subject. 

I've also added a timer for non-stop fun, until the timer stops. Then the fun is over.
